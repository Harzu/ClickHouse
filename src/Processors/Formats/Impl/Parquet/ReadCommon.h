/// parallel. We'd like the parallelism to automatically scale based on memory usage.

/// column indexes and there's not enough left to read main data for a few row groups in parallel.
/// To solve these two problems at once, we do memory accounting separately for each stage, with
/// separate memory budget for each stage (see ReadManager::Stage).
